        <p>Victrola, one of the leading turntable manufacturers, was born in 1906 in Camden, NJ </br>
            when first introduced to the American public by the Victor Talking Machine Company. </br>
             Full of entrepreneurial ideas and known for its use of quality materials, Victor (later becoming RCA)  </br>
             was the largest and most successful turntable manufacturer of its time.</p>

            <p>Eldridge R. Johnson worked to improve the sound quality of discs, and ultimately found a method to record sounds in such
            </br>a way that eliminated a lot of the scratchy feedback noises that were produced by Berliner’s shellac recordsand the
        </br>vintage record players. His company, the Victor Talking Machine Company, still produces the Victrola record player.</p>
